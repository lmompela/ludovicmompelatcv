# Ludovic Vétéa Mompelat

## About me

    Ludovic Vetea Mompelat is an Assistant Professor of French Linguistics, Creolistics and Computational Linguistics. His research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, Corpus Linguistics, Syntax, Semantics, and Sociolinguistics. His training in formal Linguistics with a focus on French and French-based Creoles, as well as in Computational Linguistics allows him to use a mixed-method cross-disciplinary research approach in his work. Some of his publications such as “How to Parse a Creole: When Martinican Creole Meets French” (2023)  and “To Infinitive and Beyond, or Revisiting Finiteness in Creoles: A Contrastive Study of the Complementation Systems of Martinican Creole and Haitian Creole” (2023) are articulated around two complementary axes: first, the linguistic study and formal development of Creole languages, in comparison to one another and their lexifier language, and second, the creation of NLP solutions for under-represented languages as well as their promotion in the computational linguistics world.
